# Project-3-Team-36
## AVC Plan
ENGR101 Project 3 - "The purpose of this project is to write a software which guides a robot through a maze."  

### Communication  
We have decided as a group to meet on Friday between 1-3 pm to work on the code for our project. We have made a group chat on Facebook messenger which will be our main form of communication when we have made progress, and want to report back to the group about. If we believe we need to meet as a group twice a week via zoom, Tuesday between 1-3 pm is the next alternative option.

### Installation
Installing SFML on OSX

The first step is to install home brew. To Install home-brew there are a few methods. The first is via terminal. There are two ways you can find the terminal.
1) Command(⌘) + spacebar(⎵) can be used to open spotlight search. This will be a search bar appearing in the centre of you screen. Type "terminal" in it. Click the first thing

2) The terminal can also be found in /Applications/Utilities/ folder.

3) Terminal is possible to be found by opening the launchpad found on the Mac quick bar at the bottom of your desktop.
![alt text](https://media.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Open-Terminal-from-Launchpad-Other.jpg)

After opening terminal paste the following command into a single terminal line and press enter(return)
```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" 
```
You’ll see a series of lines about what the script will install and where, hit Return again to agree or hit Escape to cancel.

After agreeing, enter the administrator password (required by sudo execution) to begin installation

After installing homebrew you are ready to install sfml
Type the following command into a single line of the terminal and press enter
```
brew install sfml
```

After installing sfml, you can install this project from GitHub. Go to the top of the home page of the repository and click the green button on the right that says "Clone or download". Then click download zip.

![alt text](https://i.stack.imgur.com/gL9dG.png)

On Mac simply double clicking the zip file will extract it. You can then save the extracted folder wherever you want.

On Mac open the file and open the AVC_Mac folder and then the AVC_robot file. Then open robot.cpp in Geany. Don't close this folder because you will need it later.

Go to build -> set build commands
Under the header "cpp commands" click the box beside "build" 

![alt text](https://mfragin.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/setbuildcommands.png?w=1108)

Paste the following flags (text) at the end of the flags (text) that is already there.

```
-lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system -lsfml-network
```

 The new command should look something like:
```
g++ -Wall -o "%e" "%f" -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system -lsfml-network 
```

Open go back into the folder where before. Go back a directory and click on robot_server and open server3.cpp in Geany.

On Mac press **fn+f8**, **fn+f9**, **fn+f5**
A terminal should open don't close it

Reopen the robot.cpp file.
On Mac press **fn+f8**, **fn+f9**, **fn+f5**

Watch the robot do it's thing

### Deadlines to note

| Hand-ins | Date | Course mark |
|----------|------|-------------|
| Plan | Thurs 4th June | |
| Code due | Fri 19th June | 5%|
| Team Log | Wed 24th June | 5% |
| Individual Log | Wed 24th June | 5% |
| Group Log Report | Wed 24th June  | 5% |

### Interferances to note
| Conflicts | Due Date | 
|----------|------|
| ENGR101 Tutorial 4 | Mon 1st June |
| ENGR 121 Assignment 6 | Wed 3rd June |
| COMP Assignment 7/6+7 | Thurs 4th June |
| ENGR 121 Lab 3 | Fri 5th June  |
| CYBR 171 Assignment 2 | Mon 8th June  |
| ENGR 121 Assignment 7| Wed 10th June  |
| COMP Assignment 8 | Thrus 11th June  |
| CYBR ENGR Test 2 | Wed 17th June  |
| COMP Assignment 9/8+9 | Thurs 18th June  |

Note the large gap between the 11th and the 17th. This is where we should be getting a lot of work done and can be treated as both a catch up and a get ahead period for the project. Challenge code may be written in this time. If this happens challenge test case creation will have to be accerated and more minds put towards it.

After report submission is Assignment 10 for Comp and Cybr Test 2. Because of this we may want to complete the parts sooner than scheduled. 

### Timeline
Note this is a team timeline and the Invidvidual Report will have to be completed in your own time. This time is provided while finalising the Group report and logs between the Friday 19th and Wednesday 24th of May however should be worked on throughout by the individual.

## Exploring possible test cases - Core

- If robot has an obstacle in sight, finds a way to avoid it and change direction
- How the robot changes direction, successfully able to keep speed when turning
- Robot finds a way to intersect obstacles
- Robot stops when it detects flag
- How good is the robot able to detect the white line and follow it
- How well does the robot follow the white line? Is it constantly correcting itself?

## Exploring possible test cases - Completion

- Robot needs to detect white line rather than just white pixel as the images have a white background
- Robot needs to determine which way to go when there are two directions that the robot could go too
- If the robot goes the wrong direction and hits a deadend, how does it know to turn around?
- Second half of the maze, they are missing a white pixel where the lines don't quite meet at the corners. Making sure that the robot does not go off track.
- Right angled corners instead of curvy lines

## Exploring possible test cases - Challenge

- Challenge has no white line and therefore, we aren't able to detect white pixels anymore
- There are a number of corners where the robot has to turn
- How accurate can we get the robot to turn, because if it is slightly off, the robot might get stuck at a wall
- How can we keep the robot at the centre of the maze as there is no line to follow?
- Again, making sure the robot stops when it detects the flag
